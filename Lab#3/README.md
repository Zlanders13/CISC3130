Project Name: Sorting Top Artists on Spotify List by name

This project,Lab#3, is a continuation of a previous project, Lab#2, in my Data Structures Class. 
For lab two our objective was to create a list of the top streamed artists, data taken from Spotify top charts(CSV), and count how many times they appeared on the list. 
For Lab #3 our objective was to alphabetize the list of the top artists. 

This project was coded used JAva. 
In order to alphabetize the list of top artists I used Java frameworks. 

Included in the file is the source code and class file, the CSV from Spotify, and the sorted Artists file .
